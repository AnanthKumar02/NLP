            "Key improvements and explanations:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`import java.util.*`**:  Crucially includes all necessary classes for lists and sorting.\n",
            "* **`ArrayList`**: Uses `ArrayList` as the list implementation.  It's generally the best default unless you have a specific reason to use another `List` implementation.\n",
            "* **`Collections.sort()`**:  This is the primary method for sorting lists in Java. It leverages the natural ordering of the objects in the list (if they implement `Comparable`) or a `Comparator` you provide.\n",
            "* **Natural Ordering (Comparable)**:  The `Person` class now implements `Comparable<Person>`.  This means it defines how `Person` objects are naturally compared to each other. The `compareTo` method defines this logic (in this case, by age).  When you call `Collections.sort(people)` *without* a `Comparator`, this `compareTo` method is used.\n",
            "* **Custom Sorting (Comparator)**: Demonstrates using a `Comparator` to sort `Person` objects by name. A lambda expression is used here for brevity and clarity: `(p1, p2) -> p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName())`.  This creates an anonymous `Comparator` that compares the `name` property of two `Person` objects.\n",
            "* **Descending Order**: Uses `Collections.reverseOrder()` to sort in descending order. This works for lists where the elements implement `Comparable`.\n",
            "* **Clear Examples**:  The code provides several examples:\n",
            "    * Sorting `Integer` objects (ascending).\n",
            "    * Sorting `String` objects (ascending, lexicographically).\n",
            "    * Sorting `Integer` objects (descending).\n",
            "    * Sorting a custom `Person` class by age (using `Comparable`).\n",
            "    * Sorting a custom `Person` class by name (using a `Comparator`).\n",
            "* **`toString()` method**: Added a `toString()` method to the `Person` class to make printing the list easier and more informative.  This is *essential* for debugging and understanding what's in your lists.\n",
            "* **Java 8+ `List.sort()`**:  Added an example of using the `List.sort()` method, which is available in Java 8 and later.  This is a more modern and often more concise way to sort lists.  Uses method references (e.g., `Integer::compareTo`) and `Collections.reverseOrder()` to provide the sorting logic.\n",
            "* **Copy List:** Creates a copy of the list when sorting it in descending order to avoid modifying the original list.\n",
            "* **Complete and Executable**:  This code is a complete, runnable Java program. You can copy and paste it directly into your IDE and it will work.\n",
            "* **Comprehensive Comments**:  Includes detailed comments explaining each step.\n",
            "* **Uses `Integer.compare`**: `Integer.compare` is the preferred way to compare integers because it handles potential integer overflow issues correctly.\n",
            "\n",
            "How to use it:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Copy the code** into a `.java` file (e.g., `ListSortingExample.java`).\n",
            "2.  **Compile the code:** `javac ListSortingExample.java`\n",
            "3.  **Run the code:** `java ListSortingExample`\n",
            "\n",
            "This will print the unsorted and sorted lists to the console, demonstrating the different sorting techniques.  This complete and improved example will be much easier to understand and use.  It also shows the most common and recommended ways to sort lists in Java.\n",
